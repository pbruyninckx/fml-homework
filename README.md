# Foundations of Machine Learning: Homework

I'm working my way through the [Foundations of Machine Learning](https://bloomberg.github.io/foml) course by bloomberg.
This repository will contain my answers to the homework assignments.

For each homework I will start with the given files (which are evidently not my work).
The answers however will be my own work.
